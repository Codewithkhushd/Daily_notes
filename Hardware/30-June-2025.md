## Components of CPU:
### 1. Motherboard : 
A motherboard is the main circuit board inside a computer that connects and allows communication between all the different components and peripherals.

What does a motherboard do? <br>
It houses the CPU, memory (RAM), storage devices, and expansion cards.
Provides slots and sockets for components to plug into.
Contains chipsets that manage data flow between the CPU, memory, and peripherals.<br>

#### Key parts of Motherboard:
- _CPU Socket_: <br>
   It is mechanical and electrical interface on a motherboard that securely connects a central processing unit (CPU) to the rest of the computer system.
- _Chipset_:<br>
Controls communication between CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals.
Usually divided into Northbridge (handles CPU to RAM and graphics) and Southbridge (handles input/output).<br>
- _CMOS Battery_:<br>
Small battery that powers the BIOS settings memory when the PC is off.<br>
- _Storage Connectors_:<br>
   - SATA ports for connecting hard drives and SSDs.
   - M.2 slots for newer, faster SSDs.<br>
- _RAM Slots (Memory Slots)_:<br>
   - Slots where RAM (memory) modules are inserted.
   - Usually 2 to 8 slots, supporting different types of RAM (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5).<br>
- _Expansion Slots (PCI, PCI Express)_:<br>
   - Used for adding expansion cards like graphics cards, sound cards, network cards.
   - PCI Express (PCIe) is the modern standard with different lane sizes (x1, x4, x8, x16).< br>
- _BIOS/UEFI Chip_:<br>
   - Firmware that boots up the system and manages hardware initialization.
- _Input/Output (I/O) Ports_:<br>
   - Ports on the back panel for connecting peripherals: USB, audio jacks, Ethernet, HDMI, DisplayPort, PS/2, etc.<br>
- _Power Connectors_
(Connectors for power supply cables):<br>
  - 24-pin main power connector.
  - 4 or 8-pin CPU power connector.<br>
- _Cooling Components_:<br>
  - Heatsinks on chipset and VRMs to dissipate heat.

### 2. Fan :

* Used for cooling the internal components.
* May be attached to the **CPU**, **cabinet**, or **power supply**.
* Prevents overheating and ensures airflow inside the cabinet.



### 3. Power Supply with Fan :

* Provides **electrical power** to all parts of the computer.
* Has a **built-in fan** to cool itself during operation.
* Converts electricity from the wall (AC) to usable computer power (DC).



### 4. Connectors :

* Cables and plugs that connect components to the power supply and motherboard.
* Types include:

  * **Power connectors** (SATA, Molex)
  * **Data connectors** (SATA cables for HDD/optical drive)



### 5. Expansion Slots :

* Found on the motherboard.
* Used to insert extra cards like:

  * **Graphics cards**
  * **Sound cards**
  * **Wi-Fi/network cards**



### 6. Hard Disk Drive (HDD) :

* Stores data, software, and the operating system.
* Located **under the optical drive** in the cabinet.
* Connected to the motherboard with **SATA data and power cables**.


### 7. Optical Drive (CD/DVD Drive) :

* Used to read/write **CDs and DVDs**.
* Located **in front of the power supply**, usually near the top front of the cabinet.
* Connected using **SATA data and power connectors**.







## RAM ( Random Access Memory ) V/S Cache Memory:
| Feature            | **RAM**                                        | **Cache**                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Speed**       | **Slower** than cache                          | **Faster** than RAM (very high speed)                |
|  **Size**        | Much **larger** (e.g., 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB)     | Much **smaller** (e.g., 2 MB, 8 MB, 32 MB)           |
|  **Purpose**     | Stores data for **currently running programs** | Stores **frequently used CPU instructions and data** |
|  **Access Time**  | slower access          | quick access by CPU             |


 - _Why we use cache Memory_:<br>
     * Cache memory is a small, super-fast memory located close to the CPU.
     * It stores frequently used data and instructions so the CPU can access them quickly.
     * This reduces the time the CPU waits for data from slower RAM, speeding up overall computer performance.
     * Without cache, the CPU would be much slower because it would constantly wait for data.<br>






## RAM (Random Access Memory V/S Hard Disk):


| Feature              | RAM (Random Access Memory)           | Hard Disk                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Temporary memory for currently running programs | Permanent storage for files, software, and OS  |
| **Storage Type**   | Temporary (loses data when off)                   | Permanent (keeps data when off)|
| **Speed**            | Much faster                                     | Slower compared to RAM                         |
| **Storage Capacity** | Smaller                   | Larger                  |
| **Access Method**    | Direct access by CPU                            | Slower access through file system              |
| **Cost**      |  Expensive                                  | Cheaper                                        |
| **Function**         | Helps run active programs and processes         | Stores data, files, OS, and installed programs |
